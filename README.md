# Cel-Dividers
**STORY TIME!:** 

    Cel is a collegue whose workflow requires her to have serveral instances of the same tool open in her window. 
    Cel keeps one central tab with base data in it and she uses it as a gauge to organize the progress status of more specific data on the other tabs. She keeps in progress tabs to the right of her central tab and when the process completes, she drags it to the left of the tab.

    The problem was that all of Cel's tabs were marked with the same favicon and have the same title, making her click around at times to find her central tab.


**SOLUTION:** 

    Watcing Cel navigate her workflow lead me to the thought that it would be a blessing to be able to mark specific tabs in the tab bar so that you can quickly pick them out if the favicon and title are not as distinguishable as needed.
    My thought was if I could turn her central tab green, she sould be able to know that is her cental point, quickly see her in progress tabs, and wouldnt have to tab around as much.

*This is where the idea behind Cel Dividers was born.*

Cel Dividers application could be used for many tab oranization cases:

    Visually pinning tabs for your workflow (such as in Cel's use case)
    Marking key tabs when browsing (such as my researching process - I have 26 tabs open in my browser currently to work on this project - I can probably close some, but I dont remember if they have useful info i'll need.)
    Grouping like tabs visually

Goal of this project:
    
    Create a firefox extention - and then expand to possibly chrome
    Add "Mark Tab" option to the context menu when you right click a tab
    Chose from styling options, notably: browser color picker, border color/boldness
    Slightly dim styling when tab is inactive - but keep for defaulting away.
    Possibly ctrl + click-multi-tabs to group select styling
